        <h1>Ara, the Burning Pyre</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>According to astrology, Ara is the second decan of the sign of the Bowman. This constellation represents completion, finishing, and the end of an undertaken task. In Hebrew, the word "perfect" is used in Psalm 138:8, where it is said that "The Lord will perfect that which concerns me." The Greeks called this constellation Ara, which the Latins used to denote a small elevation of wood, stone, or earth made for sacred purposes, particularly for sacrifices, hence an altar. It also means a funeral pile, which is why the figure of an altar covered with burning fire is used to represent this constellation on charts.</p>
        <p>The Greeks used the word Ara sometimes in the sense of prayer, but more frequently in the sense of an imprecation, a curse, or the effect of a curse such as bane, ruin, or destruction. Personified, it was the name of the goddess of revenge and destruction. In Aeschylus, it is the name of the actual curse of Oedipus personified. It connects directly with the Hebrew words mara and avane, which mean a curse and utter destruction.</p>

        <h2>The Under-World</h2>
        <p>In the latitudes where these constellations were originally formed, Ara was on the lowest horizon of the south. The regions beyond this were contemplated as the lower regions, the under-world, the regions of darkness, "outer darkness," just as the regions toward the north pole are contemplated as the upper regions, the regions of light and heaven. And, singularly enough, these Ara-fires burn downward, toward the dark and hidden abyss, toward the covered and invisible south pole. The whole significance of the name and figure thus connects with ultimate perdition, the completed curse, the sending into "the lake of fire."</p>

        <p>
            In the Zodiac of Dendera, the figure is different, but the idea is the same. There we have a throned human figure wielding the flail, the implement of threshing and bruising, and that figure at the same time set over a jackal, often identified with the dragon. Here is the unclean and cunning animal of darkness brought under dominion and judgment, threshed, bruised, and punished. This throned and threshing figure has a name which signifies the Conquering One, the same as in Scorpio. The meaning of the sign is, therefore, victory over the enemy, the thrusting of him into the regions of darkness, the threshing and bruising of him beneath the feet of the conqueror, the beating of him down into final punishment.
        </p>
        <h2>Scriptures Related to Ara</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Psalm 138:8 - "The Lord will perfect that which concerns me."</li>
            <li>Revelation 20:10 - "And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever."</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sagittarius</h2>
        <p>The third constellation belonging to the sign of the Bowman is named Sagittarius and is depicted as a centaur aiming his bow and arrow. The centaur is half-man and half-horse, symbolizing the conflict between the divine and the animalistic nature of man. The bow and arrow represent the weapon used in battle, and the aim symbolizes the intention to hit a specific target. This constellation signifies the spiritual warfare and the intention to hit the target of ultimate victory over the enemy.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the constellation Ara, the Burning Pyre, signifies the completion of a task, the sending of the enemy into the lake of fire, and the ultimate perdition. It represents the victory over the enemy, the threshing and bruising of him beneath the feet of the conqueror, and the beating of him down into final punishment. This is consistent with the message of the Holy Scriptures, where the Virgin-born Son of God spoils Satan and his kingdom, step after step, to complete overthrow and final perdition. The constellation Sagittarius further emphasizes the spiritual warfare and the intention to hit the target of ultimate victory over the enemy.</p>
